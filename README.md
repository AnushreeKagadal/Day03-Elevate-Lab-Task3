# My SQL Task for SQL Internship (SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY, LIMIT)

In this SQL task, I worked on the `travellers` table from my `travel_agency` database to practice data retrieval and filtering using essential SQL commands.

---

## What I Worked On

- **Exploring the Data:**  
  Started with `SELECT *` to review all records and understand the structure of the table.

- **Selecting Specific Columns:**  
  Retrieved key information such as travellers name, destination, budget in indian rupees to focus on relevant data.

- **Filtering Records:**  
  Applied conditions using `WHERE`, `AND`, `OR`, `LIKE`, and `BETWEEN` to extract targeted results. Examples include:  
  - Travellerss with Bali destination.
  - Travellers from Bengaluru with budget 90000 rupees.
  - Travellerss travelling to Bali destination or Maldives destination with budget more than 85000 rupees.
  - Travellers containing gmail as their email.
  - Names starting with 'A'.
  - Travellerss within a specific age range.

- **Sorting Data:**  
  Used `ORDER BY` in both ascending and descending order to organize results meaningfully.
  - Travellers sorted ascending or descending order based on budgets.
  - Travellers sorted by two columns first by name and then by budget in descending order.

- **Limiting Results:**  
  Applied `LIMIT` to display top records, such as the top 4 youngest travellers.

- **Combining Techniques:**  
  Built advanced queries combining `WHERE + ORDER BY + LIMIT` to answer practical questions, for example:  
  >"Top 2 travellers going to Bali with highest budget."
